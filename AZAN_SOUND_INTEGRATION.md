# ðŸ”Š Azan Sound Now Integrated Directly into Notifee!

## âœ… **What Changed:**

Your prayer notification system has been updated to play the **azan sound directly within Notifee notifications** instead of using separate audio playback.

## ðŸŽµ **How It Works Now:**

### **Prayer Notifications:**

- ðŸ•Œ **All Prayers (except Sunrise)**: Use `azan.wav` sound directly in Notifee
- ðŸŒ… **Fajr Prayer**: Special blue-colored notification with azan sound
- ðŸŒ„ **Sunrise**: Uses default system sound (no azan as usual)

### **Notification Channels:**

- **Main Prayer Channel**: Uses azan sound for daily prayers
- **Fajr Prayer Channel**: Uses azan sound with special styling
- **Reminder Channel**: Uses default sound for pre-prayer reminders

### **Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Old way (removed):
sound: 'default' + manual audio playback

// New way (current):
sound: 'azan' // Azan plays directly from Notifee
```

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the New System:**

To test that azan sound works directly in Notifee:

```javascript
import { testImmediateNotification } from "./utils/notificationTester";

// Test immediate notification with azan
await testImmediateNotification();
// This will now play azan sound directly from Notifee!
```

## ðŸ“± **User Experience:**

1. **Prayer Time Arrives** â†’ Notification appears instantly
2. **Azan Sound Plays** â†’ Directly from the notification (no delay)
3. **No Separate Audio** â†’ Everything happens in one smooth action

## âœ¨ **Benefits:**

- âœ… **Faster Response**: No delay between notification and azan sound
- âœ… **System Integration**: Sound respects device volume and notification settings
- âœ… **More Reliable**: No threading issues or audio conflicts
- âœ… **Cleaner Code**: Simpler, more maintainable system
- âœ… **Better Performance**: Less CPU usage, no manual audio management

## ðŸ”§ **File Configuration:**

Your `azan.wav` file in `assets/sounds/` is now used directly by Notifee through the notification channels and individual notification configurations.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result:**

When prayer time arrives, you'll hear the beautiful azan sound **immediately** as the notification appears, with no delays or separate audio processes. The system is now more integrated and reliable!

**Test it out and enjoy the seamless prayer notification experience!** ðŸ•Œ
