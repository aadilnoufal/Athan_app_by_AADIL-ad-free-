# Location Change Fix Summary

## Issues Identified:

1. **Async State Update Race Condition**: The location change wasn't working because of timing issues between state updates and data fetching
2. **Location Change Flag Conflicts**: The `location_changing` flag was causing unnecessary complexity and conflicts
3. **Async Next Prayer Logic**: The async function in `updateNextPrayer` was causing state management issues

## Key Fixes Applied:

### 1. Fixed `changeRegion` Function:

- **Removed** the `location_changing` flag mechanism that was causing conflicts
- **Reordered** operations: Clear cache BEFORE updating state
- **Added** proper error handling with `finally` blocks
- **Used** `setTimeout` to ensure state updates complete before data fetching
- **Simplified** the async flow to prevent race conditions

### 2. Simplified `fetchPrayerTimes`:

- **Removed** the `location_changing` check that was preventing proper cache clearing
- **Streamlined** the logic to simply check for cached data or fetch fresh

### 3. Fixed `updateNextPrayer`:

- **Removed** the async `fetchTomorrowFajr` function that was causing state update conflicts
- **Simplified** to use synchronous fallback logic for tomorrow's Fajr
- **Eliminated** async operations within the function to prevent race conditions

### 4. Cleaned Up Notification Logic:

- **Removed** `location_changing` checks from notification scheduling
- **Simplified** the notification flow

### 5. Enhanced State Dependencies:

- **Updated** the main useEffect to properly check for `undefined` values
- **Ensured** that location, method, and tuningParams changes trigger proper re-fetching

## How the Fix Works:

1. **User selects new region** → `changeRegion` is called
2. **Cache is cleared immediately** → All old prayer data removed
3. **New region config is saved** → AsyncStorage updated
4. **State is updated** → regionId, location, method, tuningParams updated
5. **Modal is closed** → UI feedback
6. **Data fetch is triggered** → After short delay to ensure state update
7. **Loading states cleared** → regionChanging and loading set to false
8. **Notifications rescheduled** → For new location if enabled

## Expected Result:

- ✅ Location change now works immediately
- ✅ Home page updates with new location and prayer times
- ✅ Cache is properly cleared and refreshed
- ✅ No more race conditions or async conflicts
- ✅ Proper loading states and user feedback
